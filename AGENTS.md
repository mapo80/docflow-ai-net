# Agents (Codex) Guide

- Call `POST /api/v1/process` with headers:
  - `X-API-Key`
  - optional `X-Reasoning: think|no_think|auto`
- Ensure a GGUF model is mounted at `/models` (compose does it).
- Output is always **valid JSON** due to **GBNF grammar** at inference, then validated against **Extraction Profiles**.

Prompts:
- The server injects `/think` or `/no_think` automatically based on header/config.
- Do not add explanations; responses must be pure JSON.
